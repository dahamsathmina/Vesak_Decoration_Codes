# Vesak_Decoration_2024
**Description**

This Arduino project is designed to control decorative lighting patterns using a 4-channel relay module and 230V 5W bulbs. It is perfect for festivals like Vesak or other celebrations, providing dynamic and customizable light sequences to enhance any event.

**Features**

Predefined lighting patterns for 230V bulbs.    
Uses a 4-channel relay module to safely control high-voltage bulbs. *(The code can be changed and the number of relay modules can be changed as required )*.        
Easy to customize for different sequences or durations.        
Designed for safe operation with proper wiring and components.    

**Requirements**

Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Mega, Nano).  
4-channel relay module.     *(The code can be changed and the number of relay modules can be changed as required )*.             
5W 230V AC bulbs     *(minimum 4 / You can take as many bulbs as you like )*.              
TT wires for high-voltage connections.      
Jumper wires for connecting the Arduino to the relay module.      
Proper power supply for the Arduino.      
Safe casing or insulation for high-voltage components.      

**Installation**

*Clone the repository:*    
    git clone : https://github.com/DahamSathmina/Vesak_Decoration_Codes_2024.git    
Open the .ino file in the Arduino IDE.      
Connect your Arduino board to your computer.      
Upload the code to the Arduino board.

**Hardware Setup**

Connect the relay module's input pins to the appropriate Arduino digital pins as defined in the code.         
Connect the relay module outputs to the bulbs :            
                                          * Use TT wires to connect the bulbs and ensure proper insulation.      
Power the relay module and Arduino board using their respective power supplies.  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>Verify all connections to ensure safe and proper operation.  

> [!WARNING]
>Ensure all high-voltage components are insulated and enclosed in a protective case.    
>Double-check the wiring to avoid short circuits or damage to components.    
>Do not handle the system while it is powered on.    

**Usage**

Power up your Arduino board and relay module.    
The system will execute predefined lighting patterns on the connected bulbs.    
Optionally, modify the code to create custom patterns :         
                                           * Adjust the timing of the sequences.        
                                           * Change the pins for different bulb configurations.      
> [!TIP]
>Feel free to modify the code to :    
                                          - Add new lighting patterns.  
                                          - Integrate additional hardware (e.g., sensors, Bluetooth modules).  
                                          - Adjust timing, sequence order, or relay activation logic.
